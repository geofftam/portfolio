# Geoff Tam
I am a project manager and data analyst working on client-facing projects spanning climate change, energy access, public health, and open source intelligence. My primary tools are R, Python, ArcGIS Pro, and STATA. I received my master's in international affairs with a concentration in development economics from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, and I am currently based in Alexandria, VA. 

# Work Samples
The following blog posts describe work that I have contributed to while employed on the Analytics team at [Fraym](https://fraym.io/), a dynamic geospatial start-up putting hyperlocal population data in the hands of policymakers, researchers, and local stakeholders in data poor geographies around the world. Please note that I was not involved in writing the blog posts themselves. 

## [Why Sub-National Data Will Be Key to Ending Child Marriage by 2030](https://fraym.io/blog/unicef-report-end-child-marriage/)
This engagement highlighted sub-national variation in child marriage prevalence and risk factors across several countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. My contribution comprised of cleaning publicly available household survey data from the Demographic and Healthy Survey in STATA, constructing a risk index using principal component analysis, and building out the analysis and visuals in the final deliverable based on Fraym's hyperlocal spatial interpolation estimates.

## [Making Sense of the Hype: What We Know about ISIS-Mozambique's Attacks in Tanzania](https://fraym.io/blog/isis-mozambique-tanzania/)
For this post, I worked with advisors from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) interested in learning more about the influence of ISIS at the border of Mozambique and Tanzania. To support the authors in this piece, I pulled conflict event points from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) API in R, constructed a poverty index from hyperlocal social data from our interpolation software, and created the spatial visual in ArcGIS Pro.

## [Using Machine Learning to Map Migration Drivers](https://fraym.io/blog/using-machine-learning-to-map-migration-drivers/)
The analysis referenced in this blog post relies on survey data collected by a third party in the Northern Triangle region of Central America. I supervised a team of three analysts to clean, translate, and harmonize the data, geocode and cluster the respondents, and produce analysis-ready hyperlocal data layers.
